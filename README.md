# Alphabet to Word Translator

This is a simple Python program that helps you learn words starting with each alphabet. It uses a dictionary where each key is a lowercase alphabet, and the value is a corresponding word.

## Features

- Type any alphabet (a-z) and get the corresponding word
- Shows error message for invalid input
- Great for beginners learning Python dictionaries and conditional statements

## How It Works

The program prompts the user to enter a single alphabet. If it exists in the predefined dictionary, the corresponding word is printed. Otherwise, it displays a warning message.
